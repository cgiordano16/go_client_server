# go_client_server

# The client server works as follows:
1. You turn on the server first from the Go_Info_Systems directory.  `go run google.go`
2. Next, you turn on the client from the Go_Info_Systems_Client directory. `go run client.go`
3. The client will then wait for the name of a bookmark such as `youtube`
